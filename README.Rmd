## `{targets}` workflow

This project uses a [`{targets}`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) workflow to fit the models and create all the results visualised in the interactive app.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
cat(c("```mermaid", targets::tar_mermaid(targets_only = TRUE), "```"), sep = "\n")
```
